Individual project consisting in building a classifier for adversarial perturbation detection. 

AY 2020/2021

## Solution

Project has been completely developed in **Python**, using the popular framework for deep learning **Pytorch**.

The steps followed to solve the problem are:
* **Data preparation and analysis**
* **Modeling**
  * **Model selection**
  * **Hyperparameter tuning**
* **Model evaluation**

The solution chosen is AlexNet architecture trained using transfer learning technique, which gave an accuracy of 98.7% on test set.
